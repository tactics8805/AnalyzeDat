  - Recall, or TPR (True Positive Rate)
  - FPR (False Positive Rate)
  - Precision
  - F1 Score
## Dependencies

## Linear Regression Model

## Logistic Regression Model

## Classification Models

### Thresholds and Confusion matrix algorithms

### Accuracy algorithm

### Recall/TPR (True Positive Rate) and FPR (False Positive Rate) algorithms

### Precision Algorithm

### F1 Score Algorithm
The harmonic mean of precision and recall. Mathematically given by:

$[F1 = 2 * \frac{precision * recall}{precision + recall} = \frac{2TP}{2TP + FP + FN}]$

When precision and recall are close in value, F1 will be close to their value. When precision and recall are far apart, F1 will be similar to whichever metric is worse.
